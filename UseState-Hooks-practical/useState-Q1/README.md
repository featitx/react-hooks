### Question 1: Basic State Management

Consider a simple React component that represents a counter. Implement the component using the useState hook to manage the counter state. The component should display the current count and provide buttons to increment and decrement the count.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  // Your code here

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {/* Display the current count here */}</p>
      <button onClick={() => /* Increment the count */}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => /* Decrement the count */}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

```

Im doing it src - App.jsx directly , You can make separate component
